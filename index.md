## Short Bio

I am a researcher in the neuroscience field, interested in body, action and space representations at the [NPSY-Lab.VR](http://sites.hss.univr.it/npsy-labvr/).
In particular, my research work is focused on patients with a spinal cord lesion,
people that are experiencing in their everyday life a body-brain disconnection from both the sensorial and 
motor functionality.
I finished my Ph.D. in 2015 in Social and Affective Neuroscience at the University "La Sapienza" or Rome (Italy) of [prof. Salvatore M. Aglioti](https://agliotilab.org/lab-staff/principal-investigator), under the supervision of [prof. Valentina Moro](www.dsu.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=2097).

I co-coordinate, altogether with prof. Valentina Moro, the ["International Research Group inot Spinal Cord Injuries"](http://sites.hss.univr.it/npsy-labvr/spinal-cord-injury-research-center/).

I teach at the University of Verona "Neuroscience of Learning" and the laboratory "Body and disability".

I am an expert in Bayesian Statistics. I coordinate the [BASIC-NPSY Research Group](http://sites.hss.univr.it/npsy-labvr/basic-npsy-research-group/) and I have organized two summer schools concerning Bayesian statistics [BayesHSC](http://sites.hss.univr.it/bayeshsc/).
